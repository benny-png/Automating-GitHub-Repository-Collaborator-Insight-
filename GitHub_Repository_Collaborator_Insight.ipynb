            "\n",
            "1. Project Overview:\n",
            "\n",
            "   The API-Endpoint-Development-OCR is a project that uses FastAPI and Tesseract OCR to provide an API endpoint for uploading images and PDF files for text extraction. However, it is noted that the current branch has some dependencies version conflicts that need rectification. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. Recent Activity:\n",
            "\n",
            "   Over the last 30 days, there have been 30 commits. These commits have focused mainly on correcting bugs, improving performance, and implementing new features. The most significant changes include the introduction of a new file upload limit and enhancements to the OCR functionality. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. Project Structure Changes:\n",
            "\n",
            "   The project has experienced substantial changes in its structure. Six files have been added, 13 files have been removed, and six files have been modified, leaving a total of five files in the repository. This is a significant reduction in the project size and could imply a shift towards a more streamlined, simplified structure. It's important to understand the implications of these changes for the project's development and maintenance. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. Issues and Pull Requests:\n",
            "\n",
            "   There are currently no open issues or pull requests. This can be an indication of a well-maintained project or a lack of active development. It's recommended to regularly review the code and open issues for bugs or improvements to maintain an active development environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Branch Management:\n",
            "\n",
            "   The repository has a main branch and two feature branches: multiOCR and multiOCR-nodb. However, there is no dev branch. For better code management and to avoid potential code conflicts, it is advisable to establish a dev branch where all the developmental codes can be merged before pushing to the main branch.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Contributors:\n",
            "\n",
            "   There are two contributors in this project. To increase collaboration and efficiency, it would be useful to identify the most active contributors based on recent commits and their areas of expertise.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Project Health:\n",
            "\n",
            "   The project seems to be moderately healthy with a steady number of commits over the past month. However, there is a lack of open issues and pull requests, which might indicate a lack of active development or a well-maintained project. It is recommended to improve the project management practices and make more use of issues and pull requests for better tracking and collaboration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendations:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Resolve the dependencies version conflicts to avoid potential issues in the future.\n",
            "- Review the project structure changes and ensure they align with the project's objectives.\n",
            "- Encourage contributors to actively use issues and pull requests for better tracking and collaboration.\n",
            "- Establish a dev branch for better code management.\n",
            "- Regularly evaluate the project's health based on commit frequency, issue resolution, pull request management, and file changes.\n"
